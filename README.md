# Challenge-Wk4

## Description

This Coding Quiz Challenge was created to work and practice on Javascript.
- What was your motivation? To improve myself.
- Why did you build this project? To understand the for loops and random better.
- What problem does it solve? It doesn't solve a problem but gives a score on based on how long it takes for one to answer the quiz. It's supposed to save the score and name of the person
- What did you learn? It's possible to brute force code to work. There's definitely an easier way to code this quiz.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Installation

N/A

## Issues
Unable to save the score and initial input. When I click 'Go Back' I get a blank page and timer flickers.

## Credits

Troubleshooted with Kyle Jocoy. Used Phind, and the video John provided on Slack. I also reached out to a tutor and AskBCS.
